# Team Leads
This repo is managed by you.
The team has read-only access, the intent of this is to make sure
that someone in leadership is aware of everyhting here. We don;t want things to get lost, 
so please keep track of what you put here. For now, the organization of content is open.
As we go on and know what we need, we'll put it in.

## Team Lead responsibilities (for github)
 - Manage your repo (MAVRIC-<TeamName>)
  - Make sure things get put on task boards and get done
  - Make sure files are entered in a way we can find
 
 - Manage team content here (MAVRIC-General)
  - Meeting minutes
  - M:2:I reports


## Using Projects
Github has these wonderful things called projects. Projects are just a way to manage work into groups.
To use projects, you need work items, these are called issues (sometimes misleading). Issues live in repositories
so to create a task
 1. Enter the repo (MAVRIC-<TeamName>)
 2. Click Issues
 3. Click New
 4. Enter title and description
 5. Assign team members
 6. Assign milestones

Don't forget to use labels. Labels help organize what an issue is about (is it a bug, an enhancement, etc.) 
To create labels:
 1. Go to Issues in the repo
 2. Click Labels
 3. Click New Label

To assign a label to an issue:
 1. Go to the issue
 2. Click the icon next to Lables on the right
 3. Start typing the name of the label.
