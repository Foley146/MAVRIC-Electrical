## Milestone 1:  [Drive System](https://github.com/m2i/MAVRIC-Electrical/milestone/2)
Description: Control of the drive system. Includes basic forward, backward, and turn maneuvers as well as heading and position feedback to the controller.

Notes: Phoenix will need to have at least serial comms, but we should finalize a communications stack before we get too far on this. We can simulate a Rocket system by hooking everything up on a local network. If we go with a network-bridge solution like the Rocket, we will most likely use sockets. Sockets will give us the flexibility to open up multiple 'channels' to and from Phoenix.
